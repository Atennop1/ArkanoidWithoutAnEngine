## About project
ArkanoidWithoutAnEngine is a project I made to learn how to develop games without an engine, to gain experience with C++ in general and also to practice OOP. It is a clone of the famous Arkanoid game, made by me completely from scratch, I only used the [**SDL2**](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL) libraries family for rendering, receiving events from the OS and cross-platform. This project has come a long way, from a simple application on the Windows API with vector graphics to a full-fledged cross-platform game with its own self-written engine. After developing the project, I separated its system part into a separate engine, which I called [**Genesis**](https://github.com/Atennop1/Genesis). The project, although very simple, gave me an incredible boost in knowledge and shed light on where and how to move on, above and beyond.

### Tools
- SDL2
- CMake
- [**Genesis**](https://github.com/Atennop1/Genesis)

## Building from source
### Linux
```
git clone https://github.com/Atennop1/ArkanoidWithoutAnEngine.git
cd ArkanoidWithoutAnEngine
cmake CMakeLists.txt 
make
```

## Conclusion
The contribution of this project to my development is hard to overestimate. I learned a huge number of things, tried cross-platform development for the first time, wrote my own smart pointer, made a complex OOP architecture, fought with bugs and linking errors, made my own physics simulation, learned how to make CMake libraries and much, much more. I am proud of this project and how everything turned out, and thanks to it I know where to go next. I want to delve deeper into CMake, learn OpenGL, move away from OOP in favor of procedural programming and make multiplayer in Unreal Engine. I have a lot of plans and I want to follow them, and I leave this project as a good and completed chapter of my career.
