# Build ArkanoidWithoutAnEngine

The entire project build process is organized in CMake and is quite simple. If you are interested in creating a fork or contributing to this project, you can build the project from sources. Here is an instruction on how to do it:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Atennop1/ArkanoidWithoutAnEngine.git
cd ArkanoidWithoutAnEngine
mkdir build

cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . 
```

As a result of this code, you will have a copy of the project folder, a build folder will appear in it, in which the project assembly will be located. Make your changes and good luck!
